  Exercise
  Write a function that implements the fizzBuzz game.

  In fizzBuzz you need to enumerate all the numbers from 1 to `limit`.
  If a number is divisible by 3, rather than enumerating the number itself, you need to use 'Fizz'.
  If a number is divisible by 5, rather than enumerating the number itself, you need to use 'Buzz'.
  If a number is divisible both by 3 and 5, rather than enumerating the number itself, you need to use 'Fizz Buzz'.

  Your function receives the `limit` as an argument and needs to return an array with the fizz buzz sequence from 1 to `limit` (included).

  For instance if `limit` is `15` you should return:

  [
    1,
    2,
    'Fizz', // 3 is divisible by 3
    4,
    'Buzz',  // 5 is divisible by 5
    'Fizz',  // 6 is dibisible by 3
    7,
    8,
    'Fizz',  // 9 is divisible by 3
    'Buzz',  // 10 is divisible by 5
    11,
    'Fizz',  // 12 is divisible by 3
    13,
    14,
    'Fizz Buzz' // 15 is divisible both by 3 and 5
  ]
*/

/**
 * @param {number} limit
 * @returns {[(string|number)]}
 */
export default function fizzBuzz (limit) {
  const seq = []
  // Write your implementation here. Fill `seq` based on limit
  for (let i=1; i<=limit; i++) {
    if (i % 15 === 0) {
      seq.push('Fizz Buzz');
    }
    else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      seq.push('Fizz')
    }
    else if (i % 5 === 0) { 
      seq.push('Buzz')
    }
    else seq.push(String(i))
  }

  return seq
}
